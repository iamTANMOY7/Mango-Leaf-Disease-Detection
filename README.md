  ðŸŒŸ Mango Leaf Disease Detection using CNNs

  ## Introduction

Mango Leaf Disease Prediction is a project that uses trained machine learning model to classify diseases in mango leaves based on input images.


## Project Goals

Collect a comprehensive dataset of mango leaf images encompassing multiple bacterial and fungal diseases.
Train and optimize Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to accurately detect and classify mango leaf diseases using the collected dataset.
Gain hands-on experience in training CNN models using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow, applying transfer learning, and optimizing model performance.
Acquire knowledge and best practices for collecting high-quality data and annotations for training machine learning models in agricultural contexts.


## Data

These models are trained on a dataset of 4000 mango leaf images representing 7 common diseases and healthy leaves. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle.com which was collected from four mango orchards of Bangladesh, namely Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University Orchard, Jahangir Nagar University Orchard, Udaypur Village Mango Orchard, and Itakhola Village Mango Orchard.

The classes:

    Anthracnose
    Bacterial Canker
    Cutting Weevil
    Die Back
    Gall Midge
    Powdery Mildew
    Sooty Mold
    Healthy

The dataset is split into train and validation sets.

## Achievements
These models are EfficientNetB7, VGG16 and ResNet50 based on CNN architecture. These model achieves an accuracy of 100%, 98.7% and 98.2% respectively on the test set.
